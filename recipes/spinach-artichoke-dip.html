    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy 
    and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll 
    never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay 
    to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

    <h2>Ingridents</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cream cheese: This satisfying spinach artichoke dip starts with a block of cream cheese.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise lends creaminess and a welcome tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: You'll need grated Parmesan, grated Romano, and shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Garlic: A clove of minced garlic takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: The spinach artichoke dip is seasoned with dried basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Artichoke hearts: Drain and chop one can of artichoke hearts.</li>
        <li>Spinach: Thawed and drained frozen spinach is perfect for this easy recipe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, garlic, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Gently stir in artichoke hearts and spinach.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
