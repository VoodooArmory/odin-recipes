    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside. They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.</p>

    <h2>Ingridents</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cream cheese and cheese: The rich jalapeño popper filling is a blend of equal parts cream cheese and shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Jalapeños: We recommend wearing food-grade gloves while you remove the seeds and membranes to prevent burning your skin.</li>
        <li>Bacon: Of course, you'll need bacon to wrap up your cream cheese-stuffed jalapeños!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the filling.</li>
        <li> Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture, then put the halves back together.</li>
        <li>Wrap each reassembled jalapeño with bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated oven until the bacon is crispy.</li>
    </ol>
